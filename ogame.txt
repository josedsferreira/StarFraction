### **1. Understand the Core Mechanics**
Break down OGame into its core features:
- **Resource Management:** Metal, crystal, and deuterium production.
- **Planet Management:** Multiple planets, upgrading buildings, and research.
- **Fleet Management:** Building ships, sending missions (attacks, transports, colonization).
- **Combat System:** Turn-based or simulated combat with logs.
- **Time-based Actions:** Timers for building, research, and fleet movement.

---

### **2. Define the Tech Stack**
Choose technologies you're comfortable with or want to learn:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or a framework like React/Next.js (you’re familiar with this from past projects).
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (since you’ve worked with it) or Node.js.
- **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for persistence.
- **Real-time Mechanics:** Use WebSockets or periodic API calls to simulate live updates.

---

### **3. Plan the Architecture**
1. **Database Schema:**
   - Planets table: ID, name, owner, resources, building levels.
   - Users table: Username, password (hashed), email.
   - Fleets table: Composition of ships, destination, mission type, start time, arrival time.
   - Research table: Research type, level.
2. **Backend API:**
   - Handle user authentication, resource updates, fleet movements, and combat resolution.
3. **Frontend:**
   - Build a responsive UI for planets, fleets, and navigation.

---

### **4. Start with MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
Create a small, functional version with:
- **User Registration & Login:** Secure authentication.
- **Single Planet:** Resource generation and basic building upgrades.
- **Simple Fleet Management:** Build ships and send them on missions.
- **Combat Simulator:** Basic fight logic to resolve battles.

---

### **5. Implement Advanced Features**
Expand gradually:
- **Multiple Planets:** Introduce colonization.
- **Alliances:** Group mechanics for diplomacy and group attacks.
- **Leaderboard:** Track rankings based on points (buildings, fleets, etc.).
- **Real-Time Updates:** Use WebSockets to notify players of events like attacks or fleet arrivals.
- **Combat Logs:** Display outcomes of battles with details.

---

### **6. Use Tools and Libraries**
- **Authentication:** Spring Security or Passport.js.
- **Timers:** Cron jobs or background workers for periodic updates.
- **Frontend State Management:** Redux or Context API for managing player data.
- **Real-Time Features:** Socket.io (Node.js) or Spring WebSocket.

---

### **7. Host Your Game**
Once you have a working version:
- Use Docker to containerize your app.
- Host it on services like AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku for others to try out.
- Use a custom domain for a professional touch.

---

### **8. Expand and Refactor**
Keep adding complexity, improving the user interface, and optimizing the backend for performance as you grow your skills.
